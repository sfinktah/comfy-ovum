# Add the unique identifier of each node type you want to convert to result-wrapped.
# Lines starting with a hash are comments.

# The identifier you want is the one used in NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS
# Each non-empty, non-comment line will be attempted for in-place conversion on startup via /ovum_result_wrap_init

# For instance, uncomment this next line to always wrap KSampler:
# KSampler
