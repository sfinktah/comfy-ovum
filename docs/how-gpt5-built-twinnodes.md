Modify this code Kijai SetNode code to set and get two nodes instead of one.  Rename "GetNode" and "SetNode" to "GetTwinNodes" and "SetTwinNodes"

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
You want the current single-channel Set/Get node pair to support two channels, and to rename them from GetNode/SetNode to GetTwinNodes/SetTwinNodes. I will update the node implementations to handle two inputs and two outputs per pair and adjust all references, registrations, and extension names accordingly.

Steps:
1. Rename the extension registrations and node type identifiers from SetNode/GetNode to SetTwinNodes/GetTwinNodes.
2. Update the Set node to become SetTwinNodes with two inputs and two outputs, and propagate types per slot to corresponding getters.
3. Update the Get node to become GetTwinNodes with two outputs, resolving and applying both types from its corresponding SetTwinNodes.
4. Update all internal references and finders to use the new type names and handle both slots in validation, linking, and drawing.

prefix every app.ui.settings line with a comment saying that we don't actually have a settings panel yet.

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
You want to add a clarifying comment before every occurrence of app.ui.settings in the file, stating that there is no settings panel yet. I will prepend a comment line before each app.ui.settings usage without changing functionality.

Steps:
1. Add a comment line before the disablePrefix settings retrieval at the top.
2. Add a comment line before the nodeAutoColor check in SetTwinNodes.onConnectionsChange.
3. Add a comment line before the nodeAutoColor check in GetTwinNodes.onRename.

Instead of setting the node title to widget[0].value, set it to widget[0].value & widget[1].value.  If either widget is not connected or you are otherwise unable to get a name, then use "Itchy" and "Scratchy" respectively.

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
You want node titles to use a combination of two widget values: widget[0].value and widget[1].value, displayed as "<nameA> & <nameB>", with fallbacks "Itchy" and "Scratchy" when either value is missing/unavailable. I’ll add a second text widget to the setter, a helper to compute the combined title with fallbacks, update title assignments accordingly in both Set and Get nodes, and ensure titles update on relevant events.

Steps:
1. Add an updateTitle helper to SetTwinNodes and a second text widget used for the second name.
2. Update the first text widget callback in SetTwinNodes to call updateTitle instead of directly setting title to widget[0].value.
3. Insert a call to updateTitle in SetTwinNodes.onConnectionsChange so titles update after connections.
4. Modify GetTwinNodes.onRename to set the title using the setter’s widget[0] and widget[1] values with "Itchy" and "Scratchy" fallbacks.

name the constants (currently "Constant" and "Constant B") new names, inspired by the movie Constantine with Keanu Reeves.  Ensure the GetTwinNode has two selection widgets (rather than the one you gave it), for these two constants.

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
You want to (1) rename the two text widgets in SetTwinNodes from generic names to Constantine-inspired names, and (2) update GetTwinNodes to have two selection widgets (combos) corresponding to those two constants, and use both to resolve and title the node. I’ll add two combos in GetTwinNodes labeled to match the setter, adjust findSetter to match on both names (with a graceful fallback), and update the setter widget labels.

Steps:
1. Rename SetTwinNodes’ first text widget label from "Constant" to "John".
2. Rename SetTwinNodes’ second text widget label from "Constant B" to "Chas".
3. Replace the single combo in GetTwinNodes with two combos labeled "John" and "Chas", each listing unique names from the corresponding setter widgets.
4. Add setNames(nameA, nameB) to GetTwinNodes (and keep setName for backward compatibility).
5. Modify GetTwinNodes.findSetter to match a setter by both names (fallback to first name match if needed).

The attached file contains code for a ComfyUI node similiar to this, but with the added feature of automatically naming the constant when a link is attached.   Steal that feature.  Ensure that the existing automatic title generate code is triggered if it would have been triggered by a manual change of the constant.

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
You want the SetTwinNodes node to automatically populate its constant name(s) when a link is attached, like the reference implementation, and ensure the same title-generation code runs as if the constants were changed manually. I’ll update the connection handler to set the appropriate text widget based on the connected slot and invoke the same title update flow.

Steps:
1. In SetTwinNodes.onConnectionsChange, detect which input slot was connected and auto-fill the corresponding name widget with the connected type if empty or '*'.
2. Call updateTitle after auto-filling to trigger the same title-generation logic as manual changes.
3. Keep the rest of the update/propagation code intact.

Patches:

## Me
There are some bugs.

1. Regardless of whether a link is connected to the first or second widget, only value of the first widget is changes.  This is due to some failings in your original adaptation from single to twin node (widget/link) support.  The best fix for this is to rewrite the code to support an arbitary amount of links and widgets, as this will be a future enhancement anyway.

2. When a node is disconnected, the widget and its input do not reset, nor does its color.  (The code in `getset.js` that I supplied earlier -- from easyUse Get/SetNode -- handles disconnections correctly, model a solution after their code).

In rewriting the code to support an arbitary number of widgets, it behooves us to address some issues:

* The title will be created from only the connected widget's, joined by " & " (optionally prefaced by Set or Get as per ui.settings).
* The node color will be determined by the first connected link with a color defined in our color map.
* The default label of the widgets (previously called "John" and "Chas") will have to change to the more mundane "Constant `n`".

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
We need to fix twin-node bugs by generalizing to N widgets/links, reset state on disconnect, update titles from connected constants joined by " & ", determine node color from the first connected typed link, and rename widget labels to “Constant n”. We’ll also improve GetTwinNodes to better auto-select constants and types based on Set nodes.

Steps:
1. Rename SetTwinNodes widget labels from “John”/“Chas” to “Constant 1”/“Constant 2”.
2. Rewrite SetTwinNodes.updateTitle to build the title from only connected widgets and to update node color from the first connected typed link.
3. Overhaul SetTwinNodes.onConnectionsChange to handle arbitrary slots: set/reset the corresponding widget, input, and output on connect/disconnect; trigger title update and color changes; propagate types to getters per slot.
4. In SetTwinNodes.update, propagate an array of input types to getters via a new setTypesArray method.
5. In GetTwinNodes, replace widget labels to “Constant 1”/“Constant 2” and keep two combo widgets; add setTypesArray for array-based updates and keep existing methods working.
6. Update GetTwinNodes.onConnectionsChange to auto-select a constant when appropriate and to pair associated constants if one is known.
7. Keep the comments preceding any app.ui.settings getSettingValue calls, as previously required.

Patches:

These patches:
- Fix per-slot naming, type propagation, and reset logic for SetTwinNodes.
- Generalize internal logic to arbitrary numbers of widget/input/output slots.
- Update titles to be assembled only from connected constants and color from the first connected typed link.
- Rename widget labels to “Constant 1/2” and enhance GetTwinNodes to better auto-select constants and accept array-based type propagation.

If you’d like the ability to dynamically add/remove constants at runtime, I can add context menu actions to create/remove widget/input/output triplets.

## Me
I can see in you proposes patches, that you have not taken my "arbitary number of connections" instruction fully to heart.  You should not be writing things such as:

```python
this.addWidget(
                    "text",
                    "John",
                    "Constant 1", ...

  this.addWidget(
                    "text",
                    "John",
                    "Constant 2", ...
```

When you can instead be writing:

```python
for n in range: addWidget...
```

No code should remain that is based upon the notion that there will only be two connected links.

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
We need to generalize both SetTwinNodes and GetTwinNodes to support an arbitrary number of constants/links, fix slot-specific bugs, reset state and color on disconnect, and eliminate any remaining hardcoded “two” assumptions. We’ll create widgets/inputs/outputs via loops, dynamically mirror types per slot, propagate arrays of types, and build titles from connected items joined by “ & ”. Widget labels will be “Constant n”.

Steps:
1. Replace hardcoded creation of two widgets/inputs/outputs in SetTwinNodes with loop-driven creation and an ensureSlotCount helper.
2. Rewrite SetTwinNodes.onConnectionsChange to handle any slot index, auto-name the corresponding widget on connect, reset widget/input/output on disconnect, and propagate updates to getters.
3. Update SetTwinNodes.clone to reset all inputs generically.
4. Replace GetTwinNodes’ two combo widgets and two outputs with dynamic creation helpers that can expand as needed and mirror the matched setter.
5. Update GetTwinNodes.onConnectionsChange to auto-select constants when there’s only one known option for a given slot and to attempt auto-pairing constants from matched setters.
6. Modify GetTwinNodes.onRename to match setters using partial array matching, ensure outputs and combo widgets to match setter size, set types as an array, and build the title from selected/connected items, with color from the first typed output.

Patches:

## Me
In SetTwinNodes, you are not getting the name/label of the connection and setting the constant widget.value and the input.label with it.  Check again how it is done in `getset.js`.  For the avoidance of doubt: When a link is connected: instead of changing the input label to the **type** of the connected output, we should change it to the **label** of that output (else **name**, else **type**).

Also, when multiple inputs have the same label, we should add a number to EACH of them, starting with 1.

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
We need to adjust SetTwinNodes so that, on link connect, it uses the connected output’s label/name/type to set both the corresponding constant widget value and the input’s label (and name), and to number duplicate labels across inputs. Also ensure this works for an arbitrary number of inputs/widgets and normalize numbering on both connect and disconnect.

Steps:
1. Add helper functions in SetTwinNodes: getPreferredSlotLabel(fromNode, originSlotIndex) and applyDuplicateNumbering() to compute labels and normalize duplicates across all connected inputs.
2. Update SetTwinNodes.onConnectionsChange input-connect branch to set widget[slot].value and inputs[slot].name/label to the preferred label, mirror to outputs, then call applyDuplicateNumbering(), update title and propagate types.
3. Update SetTwinNodes.onConnectionsChange input-disconnect branch to reset types/names/widget value, call applyDuplicateNumbering(), and then update title and propagate types.

Patches:

SetTwinNodes: create our title out of the preferred labels of the connected inputs
GetTwinNodes: don't restrict constants to only those that have been set in the same position.  i.e., constant 2 should be able to get a value that was set in constant 1.

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
You want two targeted changes: (1) SetTwinNodes should build its title from the preferred labels of connected inputs (label → name → type), and (2) GetTwinNodes’ constant dropdowns must list all constants across any positions, not just the same index.

Steps:
1. Update SetTwinNodes.updateTitle to iterate connected inputs and use each input’s label/name/type to build the title.
2. Update the values provider in GetTwinNodes.ensureGetterWidgetCount to collect constants from all setter widgets across any indices, deduplicate, and sort.

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
You want two focused changes. First, SetTwinNodes’ title should be built from the preferred labels of connected inputs (label → name → type). Second, GetTwinNodes’ constant dropdowns should aggregate constants from any position across all setters, not just the same index. I’ll update updateTitle in SetTwinNodes and the values provider used to populate the combo widgets in GetTwinNodes.

Steps:
1. Modify SetTwinNodes.updateTitle to iterate connected inputs and use input label/name/type to build the title.
2. Modify GetTwinNodes.ensureGetterWidgetCount values providers to aggregate all constants from all positions across all setters.

Patches:

## Me
Bug: in GetTwinNodes, when a constant from a "constant 2" is selected as the first node, a second node is not automatically created.
Bug: in SetTwinNodes, you should apply the same label to the output nodes as the input nodes -- you have forgotten in include the unique number that is affixed when duplicates occur.

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
We need two targeted fixes. First, in GetTwinNodes, selecting a constant that originated from another index (“constant 2”) as the first combo must still find the correct setter, expand widgets/outputs to match, and auto-fill missing constants. Second, in SetTwinNodes, after duplicate numbering is applied to input labels, outputs must inherit the exact same numbered labels.

Steps:
1. Update SetTwinNodes.applyDuplicateNumbering to also copy the finalized input label/name onto the corresponding output’s name (and label if available) for each slot.
2. Update GetTwinNodes.findSetter to match setters by chosen constants irrespective of index position (contains-all behavior).
3. Enhance GetTwinNodes.onRename to auto-create additional combo widgets/outputs to match the matched setter length and auto-fill any empty combos from the matched setter’s widget values.

Patches:

GetTwinNodes should change color based on the same rules as SetTwinNodes.

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
You want GetTwinNodes to update its color using the same rule as SetTwinNodes (based on the first connected typed link) and to refresh color on both connect and disconnect events. Also, outputs in SetTwinNodes already copy numbered input labels; we keep that intact.

Steps:
1. In GetTwinNodes.onRename, change color selection to pick the first connected typed output (mirroring the SetTwinNodes logic) and reset colors if none.
2. In GetTwinNodes.onConnectionsChange, trigger onRename on output disconnects to refresh color/title.

Patches:

## Me
Bug in SetTwinNodes:  you are correctly renaming a second usage of an existing constant by appending "_0" to it, but you are only doing it for the first constant.

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
We need to fix two issues. First: in SetTwinNodes, ensure uniqueness suffixing (e.g., “_0”, “_1”) is applied for any constant widget, not just the first one. Second: also mirror the numbered input labels onto the outputs. We will add a generic validateWidgetName(graph, idx) and use it wherever names are set, adjust callbacks and connection handlers to call it, and update output labels alongside names.

Steps:
1. Add validateWidgetName(graph, idx) to enforce global uniqueness for any widget index and remove/replace the old validateName function.
2. In SetTwinNodes’ widget callbacks, call validateWidgetName(graph, idx) and keep previousName logic for idx 0.
3. In SetTwinNodes.onConnectionsChange (input connect), call validateWidgetName(graph, slot) instead of validating only slot 0.
4. Update applyDuplicateNumbering to also set outputs’ labels and call validateWidgetName for each updated slot.
5. Update mirrorOutputFromInput to copy labels as well as names.

Patches:

The title should be made from the value of the widgets, rather than the label of the inputs.

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
You want SetTwinNodes to build its title from the values of its widgets, not from input labels. I will update SetTwinNodes.updateTitle to use each connected widget’s value (with existing fallbacks) while keeping the color logic intact.

1. Replace SetTwinNodes.updateTitle to iterate widgets, include only those whose corresponding input is connected, and use widget values to build the title.
2. Keep the color selection logic based on the first connected typed input unchanged.

Patches:

Don't add numbers to labels to make them unique.

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
You want to stop appending numbers to labels for uniqueness. I will modify SetTwinNodes.applyDuplicateNumbering to no longer add numeric suffixes; instead it will keep labels as-is (duplicates allowed), sync outputs’ labels to inputs, and only fill widget values if empty.

Steps:
1. Replace SetTwinNodes.applyDuplicateNumbering with a version that sets labels based on current base labels without numbering.
2. Keep syncing outputs’ labels to inputs and optionally fill empty widget values; do not alter non-empty widget values.

Patches:

GetTwinLabels: Is not changing color.  It should change color when (and only when) a constant is selected, and follow the same coloration rules at SetTwinLabels based on the type of the constant.  It should also change the type and name of the output node to match the constant (and it's type)

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
You want GetTwinNodes to update its color only when a constant is selected, using the same color rule as SetTwinNodes (based on the selected constant’s type). Also, each output’s name must be the selected constant text and its type must match that constant’s type. I will update onRename to map selected constants to the matched setter’s input types, set output name/type/label accordingly, and colorize based on the first selected constant with a concrete type; reset color when nothing is selected.

Steps:
1. In GetTwinNodes.onRename, compute a mapping from selected widget values to the matched setter’s input types.
2. Ensure outputs count matches the number of current widgets and set each output’s name to the selected constant value and type to the matched type (or '*' if unknown).
3. Change color only when at least one constant is selected and mapped to a non-'*' type; otherwise reset color.
4. Keep the title built from selected widget values.

Patches:

## Me
The code for automatically determining associated constant pairs in GetTwinNodes works great when you select a widget that corrosponds to a first position widget, however if you select a widget that corrosponds to a second position widget then it autofills your current widget's second position with the corrosponding widgets second position -- which is the same as the your current widget's first position!

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
When a constant chosen in GetTwinNodes belongs to a different index in the matched SetTwinNodes, your current “autofill empties by same index” logic duplicates the same constant into multiple positions. We’ll change the autofill to fill empty selections with the first unmatched constants from the matched setter, regardless of index, so counterpart(s) are chosen correctly.

Steps:
1. In GetTwinNodes.onRename, replace the “Autofill any empty selections” block to:
    - Build a list of all constants from the matched setter.
    - Build a set of currently selected values.
    - For each empty selection, assign the next setter constant not already selected.
2. Keep the rest of the rename logic (outputs/types/color) intact.

Patches:

Add an entry to GetTwinNodes's combo list to allow resetting the widget value to it's initial state (unset).  Upon this happening: should there be more than 1 unset widget, the first unset widget and it's corrosponding output link should be removed.

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
You want a reset option in each GetTwinNodes combo to clear that widget’s value. When selected, if more than one widget is unset, remove the first unset widget and its output slot/links. I’ll add a “(unset)” entry to the combo values and update onRename to handle clearing, removing the extra unset widget and its output, then proceed with the existing type/color/title logic.

Steps:
1. Add “(unset)” to the combo values list returned by GetTwinNodes.ensureGetterWidgetCount.
2. In GetTwinNodes.onRename, before any other logic:
    - Convert any “(unset)” selection to an empty value.
    - If more than one widget is unset, remove the first unset widget and its corresponding output slot after disconnecting its links.
    - Recompute node size and continue with the usual rename flow.

Patches:

## Me
When a widget is unset it's links should be disconnected.

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
You want GetTwinNodes to disconnect any existing links when a widget is unset. I’ll update onRename to remove links for all unset widgets, not just when removing the first unset, so any output corresponding to an unset widget will have its links disconnected.

Steps:
1. In GetTwinNodes.onRename, after converting “(unset)” to empty values, gather all unset widget indices.
2. For each unset index, disconnect all links from the corresponding output.
3. Keep the existing behavior of removing the first unset widget and its output if more than one widget is unset.

Patches:

## Me
Can you suggest any reason why this code to add an option to create one of our nodes does not automatically connect the output of a GetTwinNodes to the input that opened the menu, but the reverse functionality with SetTwinNodes works fine?

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
Auto-connect after creating GetTwinNodes likely fails because, at creation time, the node has no outputs and no concrete types yet, while SetTwinNodes does. The editor’s auto-connect uses the new node’s existing slots and types immediately; if GetTwinNodes hasn’t created outputs or set types, there’s nothing to connect.

Likely causes and fixes:
- No outputs at creation
    - Cause: The constructor ensures zero outputs initially and only creates them later (e.g., after a constant is chosen or a matching setter is found).
    - Fix: Ensure at least one output exists before attempting the auto-connect. For example, in the creation flow or constructor, call a method to create a default output slot (type "*"), then perform the connection.

- Outputs/types are derived asynchronously
    - Cause: You populate outputs/types in onRename or after widget selection, but your menu callback tries to connect immediately upon node creation.
    - Fix: Defer connect until after outputs are created and typed. Typical approaches:
        - Set an initial, permissive output (name "Constant 1", type "*") synchronously and connect now.
        - Or, wrap the connect logic in a microtask/setTimeout 0 and invoke onRename first (e.g., preselect a constant or find a setter), then connect once outputs exist.

- Type guard/validation prunes the link
    - Cause: If GetTwinNodes sets a non-matching type after the link is created, your validateLinks method may remove the link. SetTwinNodes tends to have the input type ready at creation; GetTwinNodes may change its output type after the fact.
    - Fix: Either connect when the output type is final or keep output type "*" during the initial connect (your link validation already skips removal when the output type is "*").

- Wrong slot indices or missing labels
    - Cause: Auto-connect routines typically connect outSlot 0 to the clicked input index. If GetTwinNodes doesn’t have outSlot 0 yet, the connect fails.
    - Fix: Guarantee outSlot 0 exists before connect; also make sure you pass the correct slot indices to the connect call.

- Menu registry hints mismatch
    - Cause: The UI chooses candidate nodes by slot type hints. If GetTwinNodes has zero outputs or no type metadata, it might be shown (because you force-register it), but the connect still fails due to missing output at runtime.
    - Fix: Provide a default output and type so the engine can both list and connect it reliably.

Practical pattern that mirrors SetTwinNodes’ behavior:
- On creation, ensure at least one output exists with name/value “Constant 1” and type "*".
- Immediately call your rename routine to try to match a setter and set the types.
- Perform the connect after the output slot is available (synchronously if you create it immediately; or with a short deferral if your rename logic is async).
- If the clicked input has a concrete type and you can determine the matching constant, prefill the first combo with that constant before connecting, so the output gets the right type and the link won’t be pruned later.

## Me
GetTwinNodes: - On creation, ensure at least one output exists with a label and type of "*"

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
You want GetTwinNodes to start with at least one output immediately upon creation, with label and type set to "*". I will update the constructor to ensure one output exists and explicitly set its name, label, and type to "*".

Steps:
1. In GetTwinNodes constructor, change ensureOutputCount from 0 to 1.
2. Explicitly set the first output’s name, label, and type to "*".

When using "(unset)" to clear a widget, it automatically derives a new name for itself. This behaviour should not be triggered when (unset) is used.

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
When a GetTwinNodes widget is set to "(unset)", your current onRename logic still runs the autofill block that fills empty selections from the matched setter. That re-populates the just-cleared widget, which can cascade into uniqueness/name derivation elsewhere. We should skip the autofill step when "(unset)" was used.

Steps:
1. In GetTwinNodes.onRename, wrap the “Autofill any empty selections…” block so it only runs if didUnset is false.
2. Keep the rest of the logic (disconnecting links for unset outputs, outputs/types/color/title) unchanged.

Patches:

## Me
When no widgets are set, the title of a GetTwinNodes or SetTwinNodes should default to its class name.

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
You want the default title behavior changed so that when no widgets are set, SetTwinNodes should display “SetTwinNodes” and GetTwinNodes should display “GetTwinNodes”, instead of the prior “Itchy & Scratchy” fallback. I’ll adjust SetTwinNodes.updateTitle and both branches of GetTwinNodes.onRename to use the class name when no widgets are set.

Steps:
1. Modify SetTwinNodes.updateTitle to set title to “SetTwinNodes” when no widget values contribute to the title.
2. Modify GetTwinNodes.onRename in the “setter found” branch to set “GetTwinNodes” when no widgets are selected.
3. Modify GetTwinNodes.onRename in the “no setter” branch to set “GetTwinNodes” when no widgets are selected.

When a link is connected to the first output of GetTwinNodes and there are no other connected links and the associated widget is unset, attempt to automatically determine the value for the widget based on the label/name of the node attached to the connecting link (similar to how you automatically name constants after their input links in SetTwinNodes)

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
We need to auto-derive GetTwinNodes’ first widget value when the first output (slot 0) is connected, if there are no other links and the widget is unset. We’ll insert logic at the start of the output-connect branch to read the target node’s input slot label/name/type and set widget[0] accordingly before the existing auto-pairing/onRename logic runs.

Steps:
1. In GetTwinNodes.onConnectionsChange, at the start of the slotType === 0 && isChangeConnect block, add logic to:
    - Ensure slot is 0.
    - Confirm widget[0] is unset and no other links exist across outputs.
    - Determine the target node and input slot from link_info and set widget[0] from input label/name/type.
2. Keep the rest of the logic intact so autopairing and onRename still run afterward.

Patches:

slotType 0 is not output, slotType 2 is output.  To avoid future confusion, change all code in this file to use the LiteGraph.INPUT and LiteGraph.OUTPUT constants.

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
You want all slotType comparisons in this file to use LiteGraph.INPUT and LiteGraph.OUTPUT rather than numeric literals. I will update the onConnectionsChange handlers in both SetTwinNodes and GetTwinNodes to replace numeric checks (1/2 and 0) with these constants.

Steps:
1. In SetTwinNodes.onConnectionsChange, replace comparisons to 1 with LiteGraph.INPUT and to 2 with LiteGraph.OUTPUT.
2. In GetTwinNodes.onConnectionsChange, replace comparisons to 0 (output) with LiteGraph.OUTPUT.

In GetTwinNodes, setting a widget to (unset) removes the link the first time it is done, and clears the widget the second time it is done.  It should be both de-linked and cleared the first time.

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
Selecting “(unset)” should both clear the combo and disconnect its output link in the same action. The current code clears to an empty string, which can leave the UI showing “(unset)” until the second attempt. Setting the widget value to null and forcing a canvas refresh fixes this so it visually clears immediately while still disconnecting links.

Steps:
1. In GetTwinNodes.onRename, change clearing from "" to null when handling “(unset)”.
2. After clearing, mark the canvas dirty so the UI updates right away.

Patches:

## Me
It is still taking two steps, and it should be cleared to empty ('') not "null".

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
When choosing "(unset)" in a GetTwinNodes combo, you want the widget to clear to an empty string and all its output links to disconnect immediately in the same step. I’ll modify onRename so that during the "(unset)" handling, it both clears the widget to '' and removes any links for that widget’s corresponding output right away.

Steps:
1. In GetTwinNodes.onRename, change clearing from null to ''.
2. Disconnect the corresponding output’s links immediately inside the same loop that handles "(unset)".
3. Keep the existing follow-up cleanup logic intact.

Patches:

## Me
When it is reset, it somes takes on the name "Constant 2" even though it is the first and only constant widget.  Fix this, and also change GetTwinNodes to always call the first widget "Constant 1" instead of "Constant".  Also ensure that a second empty widget is created if the first connected widget does not automatically determine a corrosponding second widget.

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
You want three fixes in GetTwinNodes:
- Prevent label “Constant 2” remaining when only one widget exists after reset by normalizing widget labels to “Constant 1, 2, …”.
- Ensure the first widget label is always “Constant 1”.
- If only one constant is selected and no corresponding second is determined, automatically create a second empty widget.

Steps:
1. Add a normalizeGetterWidgetLabels helper that renames all existing widgets to “Constant N”.
2. Call normalizeGetterWidgetLabels in ensureGetterWidgetCount after adding widgets and in onRename after any widget removal or reset handling.
3. In onRename, after autopairing, if exactly one widget is selected and total widgets < 2, call ensureGetterWidgetCount(2) to create an empty second widget.

Patches:

## Me
An empty output & widget is still not being created when automatic corrolation fails.

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
When automatic correlation fails (no matching setter), GetTwinNodes should still create a second empty widget and output if exactly one constant is selected. Your current logic only ensures a second widget in the setter-found path; it’s missing in the no-setter path.

Steps:
1. In GetTwinNodes.onRename, inside the “no matching setter” branch, detect when exactly one constant is selected and ensure a second empty widget is added via ensureGetterWidgetCount(2).
2. Align the outputs to the new widget count and keep title/color logic intact.

# This is how things current function.

A is a node with a single IMAGE output named "IMAGE". B is a node with a single input named "start_image".  S is a SetTwinNodes node.  G is a GetTwinNodes.

L1 is a link between A and S.  L2 is a link between G and B.

When L1 is connected, by default S will inherit a value for constant 1 of "IMAGE", an input labelled "IMAGE" and a title of "IMAGE".
When L2 is connected, by default G will have a value for constant 1 of "start_image", an output labelled "start_image", and a title of "start_image".
"start_image" is not actually a valid constant (it is not in the list of constants that are sent by any SetTwinNodes), but that is okay.

When something (an input, output, widget value (a.k.a. constant) or title) carries a name identical to the operative type it corrosponds to, it is terms a "lame name".  In this example, the name or label "IMAGE" is a lame name.

# This is how things SHOULD function.

1. When G obtains a non-existant constant from B, it should retain the existing behaviour but suffix the constant value with an asterisk `*` to indicate that the user will need to pick a valid constant.
2. If L2 is connected prior to L1 being connected, then the following logic should be followed:
-  Upon L1 being connected, if the remote side of L1 has a name/label identical to its type, and if there is currently exactly 1 GetTwinNodes node with a non-valid constant and an output type that matches L1's type, then the following should occur:
    - The output label on the remote end of L1 should be changed to match the non-valid constant.
    - L1, upon detecting a change in the label of the remote end, and provided its constant is in a poorly named state, should also adopt the label for its input, constant and output.

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
We need to adjust two behaviors. First, when GetTwinNodes auto-derives a constant from a target input on first output connect, if that constant is not among any SetTwinNodes constants, suffix it with “*”. Second, when SetTwinNodes receives an input whose label is a “lame name” (label equals type), and exactly one GetTwinNodes currently has a non-valid constant (“*”-suffixed) whose output type matches the input type, then SetTwinNodes should adopt that non-valid label for its input/widget/output.

Steps:
1. In GetTwinNodes.onConnectionsChange (LiteGraph.OUTPUT, connect): after deriving preferred label from the target input, check against all constants in SetTwinNodes; if not present, set widget[0] to preferred + “*”.
2. In SetTwinNodes.onConnectionsChange (LiteGraph.INPUT, connect): if preferred label equals type, find exactly one GetTwinNodes node with a starred constant and an output typed to this type; if found, adopt that constant (including “*”) as the label/value for the corresponding input, widget, and output.

Patches:

## Me
The suffixed "*" should not be adopted, and the remote end of L1 should have it's output label to to the new name.

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
We need SetTwinNodes to stop adopting the trailing “*” when it pulls a candidate name from a GetTwinNodes with a starred constant. Additionally, when this adoption happens, the remote origin output (the A node’s output in your example) should have its output label updated to the new, de-starred name.

Steps:
1. In SetTwinNodes.onConnectionsChange, in the LiteGraph.INPUT connect branch where we adopt a starred constant from a GetTwinNodes, strip the trailing “*” before using it.
2. Update the remote origin node’s output label (and name) to the de-starred value and mark the canvas dirty.

Patches:

## Me
Also, set the widget value of G to the name without the trailing "*"

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
When SetTwinNodes adopts a starred constant from a GetTwinNodes, you now want to also update that GetTwinNodes’ widget value to the de-starred name (without “*”). I’ll modify the SetTwinNodes input-connect logic to find the starred widget on the matching GetTwinNodes and set its value to the de-starred label, in addition to updating the remote origin output label.

Steps:
1. In SetTwinNodes.onConnectionsChange, inside the LiteGraph.INPUT connect branch where the candidate GetTwinNodes with a starred constant is found, compute the de-starred name.
2. Update the remote origin’s output label/name to the de-starred name (already done).
3. Also set the corresponding GetTwinNodes widget value (the starred one) to the de-starred name and mark canvas dirty.

Patches:

## Me
When a SetTwinNode is copied, the first widget's constant is automatically renumbered but the second widget's constant stays the same.  They should both renumber.

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
When duplicating a SetTwinNodes, only the first widget’s constant is de-duplicated because onAdded() validates index 0 only. To renumber both (all) constants, we should validate every widget value upon node add.

Steps:
1. Update SetTwinNodes.onAdded to iterate over all widgets and call validateWidgetName(graph, i) for each index, instead of only index 0.

Can you find any other instances where something is operating only on the 0th element of something?  Show me so I can confirm their validity.

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
You want a quick audit of places still hardcoded to operate on index 0 (or first-only behavior) so you can review whether each is intentional.

Steps:
1. List each 0th-element usage I can find in the current file.
2. Briefly note what it does and why it might be intentional or a candidate to generalize.

Instances operating only on the 0th element:
- SetTwinNodes constructor
    - Sets this.properties.previousName = this.widgets[0].value inside the widget callback guarded by idx === 0.
    - Rationale: previousName is used as an identifier for the “primary” constant. Intentional first-only behavior.

- SetTwinNodes.update
    - If (this.widgets[0].value) then find getters with previousName and call getter.setName(this.widgets[0].value).
    - Rationale: name propagation uses the first constant as the canonical name. Intentional, but verify if you want multi-constant naming.

- SetTwinNodes.findGetters
    - Matches GetTwinNodes by otherNode.widgets[0].value === name.
    - Rationale: again keyed to the first constant. Intentional primary-key usage.

- SetTwinNodes.getExtraMenuOptions
    - Uses this.currentGetters[0].outputs[0].type to derive a color for the “Show connections” highlight.
    - Rationale: sampling the first getter’s first output only. Probably fine for a quick color, but could be generalized to first connected/typed output.

- SetTwinNodes._drawVirtualLinks
    - Uses getConnectionPos(false, 0) for link rendering anchor.
    - Rationale: draws from slot 0 regardless of which input/output is relevant. May be acceptable as a single anchor, but could be made slot-aware.

- SetTwinNodes.validateWidgetName (call site)
    - You already generalized validation per index, but onAdded previously called it only for index 0. I updated onAdded to validate all indices, so this is addressed.

- GetTwinNodes constructor
    - ensureOutputCount(1) then initializes outputs[0] (name/type "*").
    - Rationale: bootstrapping with at least one output. Intentional first-only initialization.

- GetTwinNodes.onConnectionsChange (OUTPUT connect)
    - Special-cases slot === 0 to auto-derive widget[0] from the target input’s label/name/type when only one link exists.
    - Rationale: first-output convenience behavior. Intentional per your spec (first output is the trigger for auto-derivation).

- GetTwinNodes.getExtraMenuOptions
    - Uses this.currentSetter.inputs[0]?.type to derive a color hint.
    - Rationale: sampling first input only. Similar to the Set node’s behavior; acceptable or could be generalized.

- GetTwinNodes._drawVirtualLink
    - Uses currentSetter.getConnectionPos(false, 0) for anchor.
    - Rationale: single anchor choice; acceptable or could be slot-aware.

- GetTwinNodes.findSetter
    - Fallback path uses chosen[0] if multi-constant matching fails.
    - Rationale: “first chosen constant” as the fallback key. Intentional prioritization of the first selection.

- GetTwinNodes.setTypes (compat function)
    - Writes outputs[0] and outputs[1] directly.
    - Rationale: legacy dual-output signature maintained for backward compatibility; consider always routing through setTypesArray if you want full generalization.

- Menu-driven coloring in both nodes
    - Several places assume [0] to pick a color sample (first getter/first output or first setter/first input).
    - Rationale: convenience; could be generalized to “first connected typed slot” across the board.

If you want me to generalize any of these to N slots (for example, color sampling from first connected/typed slot; anchoring links by the actual slot in context; using all constants for naming/lookup), say which ones you want changed and I’ll prepare focused patches.

## Me
Fix both _drawVirtualLinks.
Fix GetTwinNodes constructor and change to ensureOutputCount(2).
Fix GetTwinNodes.setType.
Generalize all instances of assuming [0] to pick a color sample.
Add a comment to all other instances you noted, with "TODO: Check" and the reason you noted them.

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
You want several fixes and refactors in setgetnodes.js:
- Correct both virtual link drawing methods to use proper slot anchors.
- Make GetTwinNodes start with 2 outputs.
- Add/fix GetTwinNodes.setType for compatibility.
- Generalize color sampling to use the first connected, typed slot instead of hardcoded [0].
- Annotate other first-element-only usages with TODO comments and reasons.

Steps:
1. Fix SetTwinNodes._drawVirtualLinks to compute start/end positions from real slot anchors (first typed output/input, fallback to 0).
2. Fix GetTwinNodes._drawVirtualLink to anchor from the setter’s first typed input and this node’s header area as before, using real positions.
3. Change GetTwinNodes constructor to ensureOutputCount(2) and initialize both outputs to "*".
4. Add GetTwinNodes.setType(type) to set the first output’s type/name and validate links.
5. Generalize color sampling in SetTwinNodes.getExtraMenuOptions and GetTwinNodes.getExtraMenuOptions to the first connected typed slot.
6. Add TODO comments at other 0th-only usages: previousName, update propagation via widgets[0], findGetters keyed to widgets[0], slot 0 auto-derive in GetTwinNodes.onConnectionsChange, fallback chosen[0] in findSetter, legacy setTypes for [0]/[1].

When this node is deserialized, GetTwinNode resets it's output and widget data (probably while attempting to automatically generate a name to a connected link).  GetTwinNode should respect serialized data.

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
GetTwinNodes is auto-deriving names/types during graph restore, overwriting serialized widgets/outputs. We’ll add a short-lived “restoring” flag during deserialization and skip any auto-derive/auto-pair/auto-title logic while it’s set. Specifically: mark __restoring in onConfigure, then early-return in onConnectionsChange and onRename when restoring.

Steps:
1. Add an onConfigure method to GetTwinNodes that sets this.__restoring = true and clears it shortly after configure completes.
2. In GetTwinNodes.onConnectionsChange, add an early return when this.__restoring is true.
3. In GetTwinNodes.onRename, add an early return when this.__restoring is true.

Include a wonderful description of this node in README.md.  Don't use emoticons.

## AI Assistant
Analysis:
You want a rich, user-friendly description of the Twin connector node pair added to README.md. I’ll append a new section describing SetTwinNodes and GetTwinNodes, their purpose, key behaviors, and usage tips.

Steps:
1. Open README.md and append a new section titled “Twin Connectors: SetTwinNodes and GetTwinNodes”.
2. Describe the nodes, their behaviors (dynamic constants, auto-naming, star suffix, colorization, serialization safety), and how to use them.
